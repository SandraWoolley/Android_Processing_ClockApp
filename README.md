# Android_Processing_ClockApp
A simple Processing sketch for Android Phone

To sideload onto an Android phone - phone needs to be in eveloper mode and connected to computer, unlocked and with USB debugging enabled.

In Processing select 'Android' mode rather than default 'Java' (see top right in Processing IDE)
Now an Android menu tab will be available.  Open this and select 'Devices'â€“ your phone should be visible.

Now run the Processing sketch.
It may take quite a few seconds and there may be quite a few messages in the console (possibly you will be asked to install the Android SDK)b.
If all goes well the App should appear on your phone.

NB. Several tweaks were made to the Processing code compared to WearOS and desktop clock sketches this is because the Android screen is very tall (i.e., height is much larger than width).
